I'm a software engineer with over two decades of experience in developing full-stack custom solutions. Proficient in .NET (C#/VB), Javascript/CSS, database design and administration (MSSQL, MySQL), and managing Windows services and environments (Exchange, IIS, SQL, etc). 

Some of my achievements include developing Cost Recovery Billing software complete with Credit Card processing, custom fax solutions, commercializing Medical Billing software, and building a HIPAA-compliant data center for Patient Care Records management.

I have been a leader, problem solver, and integration/deployment specialist.

I've been passionate about working with First Responders by providing cost-recovery and support solutions that improve operations.

I enjoy making life easier for those I work with by developing automated solutions.
